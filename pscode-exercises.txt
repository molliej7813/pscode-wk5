// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers:

START
1. input1 is firstNumber
2. input2 is secondNumber
3. sum = firstNumber + secondNumber
4. output -> sum
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd:

START
1. Input a number -> n
2. if (n % 2 == 0) output-> "n is even"
   else output-> "n is odd"
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

START
1. sum = 0
2. min and max are the first number entered.
3. take in an input called n and repeat it 5 times.
4. if n < min n = min.
5. if n > max n = max.
6. sum = sum of the 5 inputs.
7. average = sum / amount of inputs (5).
8. output -> the average is average
9. output -> the smallest number is min
10. output-> the biggest number is max.
END
